@tik Product pictures in order email

Purpose
=======

Our customers like it if the order confirmation email includes product photos - this way, they can quickly scan the email and know the products are correct, without having to read the mail.

Product photos in order emails are good for us as well: Due to local regulations we have a high turnover of inventory and packaging staff and giving printouts or order emails containing images helps get them off the ground quicker with less training required.

This extension adds product images to the order confirmation email. Especially good to have in combination with Copy customer order confirmation for owner http://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=extension/extension/info&extension_id=6371

Because this is a vQmod, no core files are touched, and the changes should carry over to the next version.

Please read documentation! 

I hope you enjoy this extension. If you'd like to donate, please PayPal at top-mba@gmx.com
